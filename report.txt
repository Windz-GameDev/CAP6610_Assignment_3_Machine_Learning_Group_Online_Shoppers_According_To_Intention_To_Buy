Question - Report which model, K-means or Complete-Linkage AGNES, is better considering
their RI scores. 

Answer - Using equal k values, the two models retrieving the following Rand Indexes.

K Means Rand Index: 0.6150412418856708
Complete Linkage Agglomerative Clustering Rand Index: 0.7377097378266066

What this means: 

The examples that were in a different or the same cluster as every other example in the dataset 
were more likely and more frequently correctly predicted as being in the same cluster or different cluster respectively 
in the Complete Linkage Agglomerative Clustering model. In other words, this means for each pair, if they shared a cluster in the ground truth clusters, 
a correct prediction by a model would have them share the same cluster in the new clustering. The same idea goes for the opposite where they do not share a cluster in 
the ground truth, a correct prediction by model would place them in different clusters in the new clustering. 

The Rand Index, according to sklearn is calculated as follows:

RI = (number of agreeing pairs) / number of pairs

In conclusion, Complete Linkage Agglomerative Clustering had the superior ratio of correctly predicted pairs to the total number of pair predictions compared to KMeans.
Therefore, according to the Rand Index metric, it is the better model.
